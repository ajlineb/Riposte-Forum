        b. Veteran user	
        c. Admin (can leave messages/delete any message/moderate)


# Tables
    1. Post table
    2. User table
    3. Comment table
# USER STORY:
AS a TechCommenting service Manager: 
I WANT a webpage/website that allows my users to create an account with a unique name and email so that they may post and comment on posts.
AS a user I should be able to see posts and create posts
AS a user I should be able to click on a post and then comment on that post

# Summary:
This will be a webpage that is like a posting service that users will be able to post new threads that other users can comment on. In order for a user to post or comment they must be logged in, which means they will have to create a username and password with a unique email. Once logged in their session will be saved even after they leave the page but only for a short while using cookies. However the user can log out when they wish.
